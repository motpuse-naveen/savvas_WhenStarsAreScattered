Display a map of Africa and point out Somalia and Kenya; Dadaab is located near the middle of the countries’ border, in Kenya. Preview all links and content before sharing with students. </p>

                   <p>Explain that in <i>When Stars Are Scattered</i>, Omar is a refugee who faces many circumstances that are beyond his control. He barely has what he needs to survive. As he navigates hunger, loss, and cruelty, he wavers between hoping for the “impossible” dream of resettlement and losing hope altogether. Throughout the lesson, guide students to think about how hope helps Omar find his way and how his outlook develops and changes.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Genre: Graphic Memoir</span> <i>When Stars Are Scattered</i> combines the memoir genre with the graphic novel format. Explain that this text is a memoir, or the real story of important events in the author’s life. Omar Mohamed told his story of growing up as a refugee to coauthor and graphic novelist Victoria Jamieson, and she recorded the story, drew the pictures, and set it in a graphic novel format. Mohamed and Jamieson worked together to tell Omar Mohamed’s story in a powerful and memorable way, specifically for young readers. Read the Afterword and Authors’ Notes at the back of the book for additional context about the author collaboration and the unique format of the book.</p>
                    
                    <p>Hold up the book and page through it with students. If there is only one copy, pass the book around the classroom and help students identify features of graphic texts, including panels, frames, speech balloons, and close-ups. Then call attention to the color palette and the depiction of the characters and the Kenyan refugee camp setting. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Features of Graphic Texts</h3>

                    <p>Use the guiding questions to prompt discussion.</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>Why do you think the authors wrote this memoir in a graphic format? What audience might the format appeal to? (<i>The graphic format is popular with kids, so the authors may have wanted to reach a wider and younger audience. The pictures also might help the audience understand an unfamiliar place or difficult topic.</i>) </li>
                        <li>What are the panels used for? What purpose do they serve in telling the story? (<i>Each panel focuses on one idea and has one illustration. The panels break up the scene and dialogue and help organize the story.</i>) </li>
                        <li>What do you notice about the frame? (<i>It contains the panels. There can be several panels in one frame.</i>) </li>
                        <li>What tells you who is speaking? (<i>the speech balloons</i>)</li>
                        <li>Why might an author decide to include a close-up? (<i>for example, to show a character’s expression or emotion</i>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As students read, encourage them to think about how the genre and format help tell this story in a unique and powerful way. </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Repetition</span> Remind students of the trailer for <i>When Stars Are Scattered</i>. Display or replay the first two sentences: “In a refugee camp, it feels like all you ever do is wait. Wait for food, wait for water, wait for your life to start.” <span class="bold">Ask:</span> <i>What do you notice about the language the narrator uses to describe his situation?</i> Elicit that the word wait is repeated four times. Then use the guiding questions to prompt discussion.</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>What is the effect of the repetition of the word <i>wait? (It helps emphasize the word wait and the frustration of waiting.)</i></li>
                        <li>The narrator uses the word wait to list several things he waits for: “Wait for food, wait for water, wait for your life to start.” The word wait is repeated, but the sentence structure is repeated too* (“Wait for <span class="longl">___</span> , wait for <span class="longl">___</span> , wait for <span class="longl">___</span> .”) How is “waiting for your life to start” different from waiting for food or water? <i>(Water and food are physical needs for survival. Waiting for your life to start is more abstract, like a feeling.)</i></li>
                        <li>Why would the authors use the same word and sentence structure to describe all three things? <i>(Using the same word and sentence structure suggests that all three things are similar or equally important. It suggests that feeling like your life can start is just as necessary as having food or water.)</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Clarify that authors use <span class="bold">repetition</span> to emphasize important words and ideas. Tell students to watch for examples of repetition throughout the text and to think about their effect on the text’s meaning.  </p>
                    <p><i>*You may want to point out that repeating the same grammatical structure, as done in the second sentence from the trailer, is a special type of repetition called parallelism. Authors often use parallelism to emphasize relationships among ideas. </i></p>

                    <p>Omar and his younger brother Hassan have lived in the Dadaab refugee camp for seven years. They’re separated from their mother, they often go hungry, and there is the constant threat of thieves. Omar plays soccer with his friends and hopes to one day return to Somalia or even get resettled in the United States. Salan, a community worker, encourages Omar to go to school so he is prepared for whatever the future holds, but Omar is torn. He isn’t sure he needs school, and he has always looked after Hassan, who has a disability. When Omar decides to go, he first feels overwhelmed. Yet he realizes that school offers him intellectual stimulation, friendship, future opportunities, and “something to believe in.” (p. 96) But then Hassan runs off and gets hurt, and Omar quits school to care for him. He finds out Maryam’s father has arranged a marriage for her, so she must quit school as well. When Maryam confronts Omar about the opportunity he has—that she does not—he realizes he must make the most of his chance. Omar returns to school and takes his exams.</p>

                    <p>Two years later, Omar is now in middle school, and he and his friends share their dreams for the future. Omar wants to be a social worker to help other refugees. But he and his friends also see the harsh reality of life for most adults at the camp. When Jeri’s dad belittles the students and their dreams, Omar recognizes that his cruelty stems from frustration at his own situation. For most people in the camp, resettlement or even getting a job is nearly impossible. When Omar meets a UN social worker and he and Hassan get an interview for resettlement, Omar believes his dreams might finally be realized. Omar tells the UN his heartbreaking story of how he and Hassan lost their home and parents and came to the camp. After the interview, Omar focuses less on school, thinking his fate is sealed. Yet he hears nothing for months and again begins to lose hope. He becomes jealous and impatient when others are selected for resettlement and takes his anger out on Jeri, Maryam, and even Hassan. Gradually, however, Omar begins to understand that although his situation is unfair and he cannot control his circumstances, “the challenge of life is to make the most out of what you’ve been given.” Gradually, Omar is learning how to find his way by navigating hardship, strengthening his relationships, managing hope, and making the most out of his situation. </p>

                    <p>Four years later, Omar has refocused on working hard at school and is one of the few students to get into high school. Yet once again he finds himself questioning his future, and at times the familiar feelings of hopelessness creep in. When Omar gets word that he and Hassan are finally being resettled, he is more mature and is careful not to pin all his hopes on something that may not happen. Instead, he stays focused and keeps going to school and caring for his friends and family. He relies on his faith and trusts that if he tries his best, things will work out. He now knows that, regardless of whether he is resettled or not, only he is responsible for his future. As resettlement becomes a reality, Omar faces the difficulty of leaving his friends and loved ones, including the hope of ever finding his mother. But he has grown and learned new ways to understand himself, other people, and the world. He is now able to focus not on what he has lost or is leaving, but on “what he has been given.” Omar’s growth helps him take responsibility for his future and find the courage to take the next step toward achieving his dreams.</p>

                    <p>Display what Omar says at the end of the story: “For me, the first years are lost. I hope that in America, Hassan and I will find our way.” (p. 257) Have students explore what has helped Omar find his way throughout the story. Prompt students with:</p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>How does school help Omar find his way throughout his life? <i>(School gives Omar something to believe in. It helps him build friendships and opens opportunities. It inspires his dream to help other refugees.)</i></li>
                        <li>Omar says, “No one chooses to be a refugee” (p. 252), but also “only I could decide what I would make of my life.” (p. 246) How do these statements reflect what Omar has learned about himself and how he navigates life as a refugee? <i>(Omar acknowledges that much of his life is unfair and out of his control. But he also knows that he is not powerless and only he is responsible for his fate.)</i></li>
                        <li>How does Omar grow and change as a person? Think about how he overcomes tensions with others, develops empathy, and maintains hope. <i>(Omar understands how frustrating life as a refugee can be, and he learns how to respond with empathy when others lash out. When he feels hopeless, he tries to see things from others’ perspectives. This helps him accept his circumstances, resolve problems, support others, and maintain hope. He also learns to manage hope by working hard to help realize his goals instead of wasting time “hoping for the impossible.” (p. 241))</i></li>
                        <li>How might reading Omar’s story help others learn how to navigate difficult circumstances? </li>

Have them add the following quotes along the continuum. Finally, have groups decide where Omar “lands” along the continuum by the end of the book.

(Note that responses will vary, but accept all reasonable responses as long as students can support them.) </p>

                                    When war broke out in Somalia, Omar and his brother Hassan lost their home and parents. They are now growing up in Dadaab, a crowded refugee camp in Kenya. Life in the camp is exceptionally difficult. Omar feels abandoned by his mother, never has enough food, and worries he may never leave Dadaab.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When Omar gets the opportunity to attend school, he hesitates. His younger brother Hassan has a disability and struggles to communicate. Omar is torn between taking care of Hassan and the chance to give them both a better life. Omar finally decides to attend school, and while it is challenging, his world and opportunities expand. 
                                </p>
                                <p>When Omar gets a UN interview, his dream of resettlement seems close. But after months of waiting, and with his friendships strained, his future remains uncertain, and he starts to lose hope. Yet gradually Omar begins to accept what he cannot control and focus on what he can. He immerses himself in his studies and recognizes that only he can decide what to make of his life. When Omar and Hassan are eventually selected for resettlement, Omar has gained a new understanding of himself, the world, and his ability to succeed despite his circumstances. 
                                </p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Theme Overview </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold">Managing Hope</span> An important theme in <i>When Stars Are Scattered</i> is <span class="bold">managing hope</span>. In Dadaab, Omar must navigate almost impossible challenges—the lack of food, the loss of his parents, and the cruelty of some people in the camp. It’s easy to lose hope or to pin all of one’s hopes on unrealistic dreams. Omar knows that much in his life is out of his control, but he learns ways to maintain hope for the future while also working hard in the present to prepare himself for whatever the future may bring. Fatuma helps Omar develop his faith. School helps him develop skills and believe he may have a better future. Deep friendships provide support. Omar gradually learns to focus on what he can control and to make the best of his situation. Hope helps Omar believe things will work out, but hope bolstered by hard work, faith, and support helps Omar make his belief a reality.

                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues </h2>

                                <p><span class="bold">Food Insecurity</span> Getting enough food is a constant challenge for Omar, Hassan, and most people in the refugee camp, particularly when Omar is a young boy. In Part 1, Omar describes food distribution, using ration cards, and instances when he and Hassan—as well as most of his community—run out of food and are forced to go hungry. (pp. 15, 60–64)
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Abandonment</span> Throughout Part 1 especially, Omar thinks his mother may still be alive, and he often searches for her at the market. At times, he feels deep despair wondering if she could have abandoned him and Hassan. (pp. 66–67, 93–94)</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Mistreatment of People with Disabilities</span> Throughout the text, there are some instances of Hassan and Jeri being bullied due to their disabilities. (pp. 76–80, 102–103, 126–127, 201) In addition, Jeri and Maryam help Omar recognize that he, however well-intentioned, might be underestimating Hassan because of his disability.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Arranged Marriage</span> There is discussion of arranged marriage throughout the text. Maryam, Omar’s friend and a top student in their class, must leave school for an arranged marriage. While the topic is sensitive, the nuanced depiction in the text offers insight into the difficult choices refugee families face and the additional barriers to education that threaten girls’ futures.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Religious References</span> Throughout the memoir, there are references to God and prayer in the refugee camp. In Chapter 9, there are specific references to the Somali community’s Islamic faith rituals and the celebration of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr in the camp. </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Suicide/Despair</span> On p. 138, there is a brief mention of suicide. (“I heard about one guy…his case was rejected by the UN and he couldn’t handle it. He . . . he killed himself.”) Throughout the story, Omar and others face feelings of hopelessness at times.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Violence</span> In Chapter 12, Omar recounts the traumatic story of his past, when his father is killed, his home is destroyed, and he and Hassan are separated from their mother. Images include men with guns, burning homes, mounds suggesting graves along the journey, and a hospital scene where Omar and Hassan are very sick. Be especially mindful if any of your students have experienced similar trauma.</p>

                            <p>The Three-Step Interview activity asks students to reflect on their beliefs about finding our way despite circumstances that are out of our control. Use this activity as a warm-up for exploring the theme in <i>When Stars Are Scattered</i>. </p>

Clarify any statements as needed and remind students that they’ll need to agree or disagree with each statement and explain why. Interviewers should take notes so they can share responses.

                            <p><span class="bold">2. </span>Place students into groups of four. Assign each group member a letter (A, B, C, D).</p>

                            <p>In this activity, students work together to identify repeated words and discuss how repetition helps convey characters’ feelings.</p>
                            <p>Follow the steps:</p>
                            <p>1. Display the following passage from pp. 66–67, where Omar thinks he sees his mother at the market. If possible, display the book so students can see the layout of text and art as well.</p>
                           <p><i>I can’t believe I thought it was her. I’m so stupid. </i></p>
                           <p><i>It’s stupid to keep looking for her. Pointless. If she were in this camp, she’d have found us by now. If she were alive <span class="bold">anywhere</span>, she’d have found us. A mom wouldn’t abandon her kids. </i></p>
                           <p><i>Would she?</i></p>
                           <p><i>I wish there weren’t so much time to think in a refugee camp. But I have nothing to do today but wait…wait…wait.</i></p>
                           <p><i>I try to forget. I <span class="bold">want</span> to forget. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.</i></p>
                           <p>2. Using the chart, have pairs or groups of students locate and discuss 2–3 examples of repetition from the passage. Then have them tell what the repetition reveals about Omar’s experience and feelings. Provide the first response below as a model. </p>

                            <p>In this activity, students work together to identify features of graphic memoirs and discuss how these features help create mood. </p>
                            <p>Follow the steps:</p>
                            <p>1. Display or have students page through the section where Omar tells the UN worker what he remembers about leaving Somalia (pp. 177–194). Have students focus on the following questions as they think about the graphic features:</p>
                            <ul class="small-bullet">
                                <li>
                                    How are the pages and panels organized? What do the panels focus on? What do they leave out? 
                                </li>
                                <li>What colors or shades are used?</li>
                                <li>How do the pictures help fill in what the words don’t tell?</li>
                                <li>Does the page or panel help show an important change in the story? How?</li>
                               </ul>
                              <p>
                                    2. Then, using the chart below, have pairs or groups of students record details about the graphic features on pp. 190–191.

                                    <p>4. Finally, have students choose one or two panels from anywhere in the text and redraw them to show a different mood.
