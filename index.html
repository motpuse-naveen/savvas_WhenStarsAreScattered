                        <li>"Where we love is home, home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts." &mdash;Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., American poet (1809&ndash;1884)</li>
                        <li>"The ache for home lives in us all. The safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned." &mdash;Maya Angelo, American poet (1928&ndash;2014)</li>
                        <li>"You can have more than one home. You can carry your roots with you, and decide where they grow." &mdash;Henning Mankell, Swedish writer (1948&ndash;2015)</li>
                        <li>"If you go anywhere, even paradise, you will miss your home." &mdash;Malala Yousafzai, Pakistani activist & Nobel Peace Prize laureate (1997&ndash; )</li>

                    <h3>Writing in Two Languages</h3>
                    <p>Juan Felipe Herrera is a bilingual poet and writer and was the first Latino poet laureate of the United States (2015-17). His memoir, <i>Calling the Doves / El canto de las palomas</i>, is written in both Spanish and English and has received praise for its readability in both languages.</p>
                    <p>Hold up the book and point out the title in English and Spanish. Explain to students that this is a bilingual book written in two languages. Then, preview some of the pages to point out the English and Spanish text throughout the book. You can also highlight examples of Spanish words used within the English text. For example, <i>campesinos</i> [kam-puh-see-nohs] for farmworkers and <i>carpa</i> [kar-pah] for tent. Ask students to think about why the memoir is written in two languages and the reasons for using Spanish words within the English text. Use the guiding questions to prompt discussion.</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>Why do you think Herrera wrote his memoir in both Spanish and English? <i>(his memories are in both languages; he wants more people to be able to read the book; he likes writing in both languages)</i></li>
                        <li>Why do you think some authors use words from another language in their writing?<i> (it makes the writing more realistic; some words can’t be translated; the words might sound better in another language)</i></li>
                       
                    </ul>
                    <p>Encourage students to compare some of the words, phrases, and lines written in English and Spanish and make a list of cognates (words that have the same meaning in both languages) as they read. 
                    </p>
					<h3>Figurative Language: Simile & Metaphor</h3>
					<p>Juan Felipe Herrera uses similes and metaphors throughout his memoir to describe details from his childhood. Tell students that similes and metaphors are examples of figurative language. Preview and discuss some examples of similes and metaphors before exploring them in the text. Instructions are included in the Activity Support. </p>

                    <p>Following a dedication to the author’s migrant farmworker parents, Herrera begins his memoir with a description of traveling the backroads of California with his parents as they move to a new worksite. On their way to a new site, they would set up camp wherever they stopped&mdash;sleeping under a large <i>carpa</i> (tent) and cooking their meals outside over an open fire. One day, Herrera’s father builds a house on top of an abandoned car and the family begins living in the one-room house on wheels. Using poetic language, including similes and metaphors, Herrera describes these experiences in vivid detail, bringing his childhood memories to life.</p>

                    <p>(time code: 1:14 - 3:00)</p>
					<p>This video shows an interview with Juan Felipe Herrera after he was named the US poet laureate in 2015. Herrera discusses how different experiences led him to becoming a poet&mdash;including traveling with his migrant farmworker parents as a child.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Ask:</span> What do you learn about the author from the interview? <i>(he was born in California; he spoke Spanish as a child; his parents were migrant farmworkers; he always wanted to tell stories)</i></p>
					<h3>California Grows Map</h3>
					<p>This map shows the diversity of agricultural commodities produced in California. Explain that many of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables found in grocery stores all over the world come from California. Display the map and have students think about the important role farmworkers play in getting these products to our grocery stores&mdash;for example, picking fruits and vegetables, planting and harvesting crops, and packaging food for shipment.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">To locate the map</span>, copy and paste the URL into your browser: <br>https://cdn.agclassroom.org/ca/resources/learn/map.pdf</p>

                    <p>Draw students’ attention to the first line of the book, “You were born on the road like your father.” Discuss what “on the road” means and remind students that migrant farmworkers have to travel from place to place to find work based on the growing seasons of different crops. </p>
					<p>Then have students reflect on what makes Juanito and his family feel at home while they are on the road (e.g., setting up the tent, cooking and eating together, Mexican songs on the radio). Talk about something that makes you feel at home. For example, “I feel at home when I am eating dinner with my family because it's a time when we are all together.” Then ask students to think about what makes them feel at home. Use the guiding questions to support ideas and discussion.</p>

                    <p>The story continues with specific memories of Herrera’s parents. Herrera describes bathing in a tin bucket while his mother sang songs about <i>Mexicanos</i> crossing the Texas border. He then describes his father making bird calls during lunch breaks and his mother reciting poetry at dinner time. After dinner, his father would play the harmonica and tell stories of his travels to the United States from Mexico as a teenager. We also learn about his mother’s role as a healer, who rescued injured sparrows and could reduce childrens’ fevers using natural herbs. These memories highlight Herrara’s love and admiration for his parents and the lessons he learned from them.</p>

                    <p>The memoir continues with Herrera’s description of the changing seasons. In winter his family trimmed grapevines in Delano. During springtime they traveled to Salinas to pick melons and other fruits and vegetables. Then, back to Delano in summer for pruning, picking, and drying the grapes. Instead of money, his father was sometimes paid in sacks of sweet potatoes, fish, rabbits, or flying turkeys. On occasion, the other <i>campesinos</i> would host a fiesta in the mountains under a large tent&mdash;a rare treat. Then, one day, his mother decided it was time to settle down so that Juanito could go to school. As his family drives down the mountains to their new home in the cities of Southern California, Juanito realizes that someday he will follow his own road and let his own voice fly&mdash;just like his parents.</p>

                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold">You were born on the road like your father</span> begins the bilingual memoir of Juan Felipe Herrera, the first Latino poet laureate of the United States (2015-17). Born in the “raison capital of the world,” Herrera moved from town to town with his farmworker parents until he was eight years old. Traveling the backroads of California, we learn about the vivid landscapes of his childhood.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Poetic descriptions shed light on his family’s day-to-day experiences, including sleeping under the stars in a large canvas <i>carpa</i> (tent), bathing in a tin bucket, and cooking over the open fire. During lunch breaks, Herrera’s father would make bird calls&mdash;specifically, calling the doves by whistling to impersonate their singing. The memoir also describes his parents' vivid storytelling through songs, poems, and animated accounts of their travels and experiences.
                                </p>
                                <p>When Herrera turns eight years old, his mother decides it is time for their family to settle down so he can go to school. Driving down the mountains toward the cities of Southern California, young Herrera realizes that he, too, has stories to tell and will one day “follow his own road” and "let [his] voice fly"&mdash;just like his parents.
                                </p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Theme Overview </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold">Migrant Farmworkers</span> Juan Felipe Herrera’s farmworker parents are central characters in his childhood memoir. Like many migrant farmworkers, Herrera’s family experienced difficulty and hardship due to the grueling nature of the work and the ongoing challenges of being transient. At the same time, they developed deep and loving connections with each other and their fellow farmworkers. Throughout the memoir, we see how Herrera’s family loves and cares for each other&mdash;creating a sense of "home" and community despite being transient.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Storytelling</span> The memoir also explores the significant role of storytelling in Herrera's family. His mother told stories through songs and poetry, while his father played the harmonica and retold anecdotes from his travels to "el Norte" from Chihuahua, Mexico, as a teenager. Through these stories, Herrera learns about his family roots and gains a deeper understanding of his Mexican heritage. He also develops an appreciation and love for language, poetry, and the art of storytelling&mdash;contributing to the development of his own poetic voice and storytelling techniques.

                            <p>Use the common examples listed below to demonstrate the difference between similes and metaphors (similes use the words “like” or “as”; metaphors do not).

							<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
							<table class="table table-bordered table-dr-1" style="width: 100%;">
                        <thead>

                        </tbody>
                    </table>
					
							
							<p>Display and read the examples aloud and have students identify the comparisons in each example. Explain that similes and metaphors are considered <span class="bold">figurative language</span> because the meaning is <span class="bold">not literal</span> (her heart is not <i>really </i>gold; his smile is not <i>really</i> the sun). They are compared because they share similar <span class="bold"><u>qualities</u></span> (her heart is precious like gold; his smile is bright like the sun). </p>
							<p>Use the guiding questions and sentence frames to prompt and support discussion:</p>
                           
                                <ul class="small-bullet">
									<li>What is “her heart” compared to? Why? </li>
									<li>What is “his smile” compared to? Why?</li>
							</ul>
							<p><span class="bold">Sentence Frames:</span></p>
							
									<p>Her heart is compared to <span class="sr-only">blank line</span><span class="stline">──────────</span> because <span class="sr-only">blank line</span><span class="stline">────────── </span><span aria-hidden="true">.</span></p>

							<p>Explain that authors use similes and metaphors to make their writing more descriptive and that there are many examples in <i>Calling the Doves</i>. Tell students to look for similes and metaphors while they read and to think about how they help to describe specific details.</p>
							<p><i>*You may want to point out that the words <span class="bold"><u>simile</span></u> and <span class="bold"><u>similar</span></u> share the same Latin root <span class="bold"><u>simil</span></u>, which means “like” or “same.” Also, the word <span class="bold">similar</span>  is a Spanish-English cognate&mdash;it has the same meaning in Spanish and English.</i></p>

                                     <li>Which words are in Spanish? <i>(fiesta, campesinos, carpa, and churros con canela y azúcar)</i> How do you know they are Spanish words? <i>(they are italicized)</i></li>
                                     <li>Why do you think the author chose to use Spanish for these words? <i>(to give a more realistic/authentic description; the words do not translate well in English; the words sound better in Spanish)</i></li>
                                    <li>What clues does the author provide to help someone who doesn't know Spanish? <i>(the illustrations and context clues: for example, the author references a “circus tent” when describing the “carpa” and the illustration depicts a party/fiesta under a tent—this helps the reader understand that “carpa” means “tent”)</i></li>
